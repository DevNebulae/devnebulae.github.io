(DS72)</h2> </div> </section>  <section data-transition=slide> <div class="grid text-media"> <div class="left bg-pink flex-column"> <h2>Introductory</h2> <div> <h3>RuneScape</h3> <p>RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created and maintained by Jagex. In this game, you can gather, farm and even slay monsters for items which you can sell to other players. The question quickly arises: “How do people determine the prices of items?”</p> </div> <div> <h3>Limitations</h3> <p>The limitations to this research are that only items which have been sold through the central marketplace have been tracked and that player-to-player trading is untrackable.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Context</h3> <p>In RuneScape, players don’t trade with each other with any real-world currency. In fact, the game rules state that that is illegal. Instead, players trade with each other with an in-game currency called <em class=italic>gold points</em>, which is commonly abbreviated as &ldquo;gp&rdquo;.</p> </div> <div class=flex-auto></div> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>The layout of this slideshow has been made with CSS grids, which have been implemented across all major browsers fairly recently.

OSBuddy tracks the prices at which players sell items and has an API which has been used to gather the buying- and selling price together with the demand of supply of items.</p> </div> <div class=fragment> <h3>RuneScape</h3> <p>The RuneScape website is the single source of truth concerning (breaking) updates to the game. It also has a price-checker function which can ratify OSBuddy's price data.</p> </div> <div> <h2 class=fragment>Hypotheses</h2> <ul> <li class=fragment> <p>Every time an update has been released, the price of an item will rise or drop;</p> </li> <li class=fragment> <p>The price is directly correlated to the supply and demand of an item;</p> </li> </ul> <div class=fragment> <h3 class=context>Context</h3> <p>In the following visualizations, you will be shown the transactional data of an in-game item called a "Raw shark". Sharks are a very important food item in the game, since it gives you health after you have taken damage from monsters or other players. This item is very important to any players killing monsters, players killing other players and players doing risky mini-games where death is lurking in every corner.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=right> <img class="cover-image black-and-white" src=img/death-altar.png /> </div> </div> </section>  <section id=update-price-influence> <div class="grid text-media"> <div class=left> <h2>Updates and price fluctuations</h2> <div class=fragment data-fragment-index=1> <p>The theory behind this hypotheses is that prices are influenced by updates, because raw sharks are such an important item to the playerbase of RuneScape. It is one of the go-to food sources and updates to Player-versus-Monster (PvM) or Player-versus-Player (PvP) content makes raw sharks either more- or less desirable depending on the impact of the update. This phenomena is usually called appreciation in economics: players either see more- or less use in a certain item and are respectively willing to pay more or less for an item.</p> <h3>Color legend</h3> <table class=legend-table> <tr> <td class=selling-price>Selling price</td> <td class=updates>Updates</td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class=fragment data-fragment-index=3> <h3>Conclusions</h3> <p>As you can see in the chart, the prices of raw sharks is only majorly influenced by a certain number of updates. At around the release of a game-balancing update on the 25 <sup>th</sup> of May 2017, a boss' drop table was altered to drop less sharks. Meaning that less sharks will enter the market as an effect. This translated to a spike in their price.</p> </div> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=4>However, in the Fishing Guild update on the 6 <sup>th</sup> of July 2017, a new way of fishing raw sharks was introduced. Meaning that the supply of sharks will be greatly increased again, causing the price to drop back to its old value before the 25 <sup>th</sup> of May 2017.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=5>On June 1 <sup>st</sup> 2017, a new mini-game was released to RuneScape called the Inferno. The Inferno is one of the hardest mini-games in RuneScape and lead to a spike of demand in supplies needed for the inferno.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=6>A very interesting observation needs to be made and that is that the RuneScape players seem to overreact every time a controversial or game-balancing update has been released. This causes the price to extremely fluctuate after or even before the update has been released and only to drop to a more normal price shortly afterwards.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=7>Concluding, updates are a cause for an increase or decrease in the demand or supply of items. In the next slide, this will be explored.</p> </div> <div class=right> <div class="flex-center-all fragment" data-fragment-index=2> <svg version=1.1 class=d3-chart id=price-update-chart preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet"></svg> </div> </div> </div> </section>  <section id=supply-demand-influence> <div class="grid text-media"> <div class=left> <h2>Supply and demand</h2> <div class=fragment data-fragment-index=1> <p>Economics in high school teaches students that there is a causal relation between the abundance of a product and its price. To link this to the real-world, think of the prices of diesel and gasoline. When crude oil becomes more scarce, like an oil-rig which has mechanical problems, the crude oil becomes more scarce and the end products become more expensive. </p> <h3>Color legend</h3> <table class=legend-table> <tr> <td class=selling-price>Selling price change</td> <td class=buying-completed>Completed buying offers</td> <td class=selling-completed>Completed selling offers</td> <td class=updates>Updates</td> </tr> </table> </div> <h3 class=fragment data-fragment-index=3>Conclusions</h3> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=4>The decrease in drop rate of raw sharks in the boss' drop table in the week of May 25 <sup>th</sup> 2017 caused the amount of sharks entering the market to drop, making the price rise. However, the amount of bought sharks decreased, which seems rather odd. One could speak of a mental effect rather than a causul relation.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=5>As seen in the week of June 1 <sup>st</sup> 2017, the amount of bought- and sold sharks decreased by the same amount. This is due to the Inferno update, adding the hardest mini-game to RuneScape. This mini-game requires vastly different gear and supplies, meaning that sharks are not sufficient. Causing the players to not appreciate sharks as much and players not fishing for sharks, because they were playing the mini-game.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=6>As seen in the previous slide, at the week of July 6 <sup>th</sup> 2017, there is a huge spike of bought- and sold raw sharks which oversaturated the market for raw sharks. Due to the new fishing method, it takes less effort to fish for sharks, causing the players to depreciate the sharks and causing the prices to drop. Players were now buying sharks en masse due to their cheap price.</p> <p class=fragment data-fragment-index=7>The last noteworthy thing is that during the last update, the prices of sharks plummeted, even though there is no direct impact on the supply and demand of the item. The reason the price dropped is that that update introduced a new fishing method which levels faster than fishing sharks, causing people to lose interest in fishing sharks. The explanation for the decrease of bought sharks is that there was a long hiatus with any combat content, meaning that players lost interest in the game.</p> </div> <div class="right flex-center-all"> <svg class=fragment data-fragment-index=2 version=1.1 class=d3-chart id=supply-demand-chart preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet"></svg> </div> </div></section>  </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script></body> </html>
